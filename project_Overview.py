# Project Idea: Basic Unit Converter
# Project Overview:
# The aim is to create a basic Python application that allows users to convert between different units of measurement. The units can be distance (e.g., meters to kilometers), weight (e.g., grams to kilograms), and temperature (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
#
# Key Features:
# Distance Conversion: Convert between meters, kilometers, miles, and feet.
# Weight Conversion: Convert between grams, kilograms, pounds, and ounces.
# Temperature Conversion: Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
# Graphical User Interface (GUI): A simple Tkinter-based interface for ease of use.
# Step-by-Step Breakdown:
# 1. Setup and Install Dependencies:
# Install the Tkinter library (comes pre-installed with Python).
#
# 2. Design the GUI:
# You can use Tkinter to create a simple window with input fields, dropdown menus for units, and a button to trigger the conversion.
